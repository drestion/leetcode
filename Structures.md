# Palindrome


## Patterns

* [Palindrome Checker](https://github.com/drestion/leetcode/blob/master/techniques/Palindrome.java)
	* Recursive definition: char[i] == char[j] && ( (i+1 <= j-1 && isPalindrome(i+1, j-1)) || i+1 > j-1)
	* Nonrecursive definition: See code

Notice that the recursion should carry enough information and you should increase the number of subproblems when necessary to exhaust ***ALL*** possible solutions.

## The Suffix model
## The Prefix model
## The Substring model
## Topological Order

## Knapsack
# Search Space Shrinkage

The idea is to reduce the search space using available information. Simiar to the gradient decent idea in neuron network training.
This technique is frequently used in Dynamic Programming.

## Binary Search

A special case where the string is sorted.

## Two Pointer

A special case where the string is not sorted.

# Sort

## Merge Sort
